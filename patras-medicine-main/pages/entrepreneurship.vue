            <h2 class="main-title">Summary</h2>
            <p>The diagnostic test of syn-PNOIA is based on a groundbreaking concept and can be described as a cutting-edge Synthetic Biology field. It introduces a new era regarding lung cancer detection, making the diagnosis more straightforward, more accessible, more affordable, and user-friendly for any customer and patient, as well as significantly increasing patients’ chances of survival. Furthermore, it can be characterized as an anthropocentric initiative that prioritizes human life. Under this context, we have learned to believe more in people than the technology itself. That’s why in this section, we aim to demonstrate the entrepreneurship part of our project and how we plan to approach investors and make our project more business attractive, in general.</p>
            <p>The confirmation results of our surveys in the initial phase of Primary Market Research among doctors make us quite hopeful of our product’s potential establishment and success. SWOT and PEST analyses are shown as bonus plus points in favor of this prospect, highlighting the fertile conditions. Besides, the latter is cross-checked by the competitor research, which indicates the weaknesses of the existing methods against ours and the insufficiency of the current market. The Risk Analysis makes us cautious but not inactive. We have figured out ways to handle every upcoming risk and possible weaknesses and threats to finally overturn them. Lastly, we have set realistic and structured goals by adequately defining and sizing our target market leveraging the TAM/SAM/SOM business model. In this way, we can know our potential both in the short and long term.</p>
            <p>These goals are financially expressed in our Cash Flow Statement, considering the Cost Sheet. We are glad to state that we have thought about a plethora of funding resources, and we are also entitled to say that we have had a positive experience through our fundraising procedure until now in the framework of the competition. Moreover, it is proved that our company can be profitable after the first two years following a worst-case scenario. In conclusion, our project seems to be very promising in financial terms and societal, too.</p>

                <li>SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market / Served Available Market) Therefore, in our case, this specific segment of the market could comprise clinics, diagnostic centers, and hospitals in Greece, which is the base country for our diagnostic kit.</li>
                <li>SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market / Share of Market). For our diagnostic test, SOM is planned to consist of clinics, diagnostic centers, and hospitals located in the biggest cities of Greece.</li>
