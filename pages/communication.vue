                  <p>On September 17-18, our team attended the Thessaloniki International Fair 2022. The Thessaloniki International Fair (TIF) is an annual commercial exhibition event of great importance for Greece that takes place at the International Exhibition Center of Thessaloniki. This action took place within the framework of the Partnership since our partners from iGEM MetaThess invited us to the Academia stand.</p>
                  <p>During our presence, we had the chance to inform the public about our field of research as a group and the problem arising from the late diagnosis of lung cancer.</p>
                  <p>We distributed brochures to interested parties, verbally informed them about our actions, and showed our comics to younger children who visited the exhibition. In addition to informing the public, we had the honor to tell the former prime minister of our country, Mr. Tsipras, about what we do now and our future goals, who congratulated us on our work.</p>
                  <p>All the presentations and the public information were done with our partners from the iGEM MetaThess Team since we both have close projects to all extents. Our presence at TIF would not have been possible without them, and we thank them for the invitation.</p>

                  <p>TED is an international nonpartisan non-profit devoted to spreading ideas, covering almost all topics- including science-while TEDx events help share ideas in communities worldwide. TEDxPatras was organized in Western Greece at the University of Patras, and Patras Medicine was part of it. We presented our project to many young people at this event and further informed them about iGEM Competition. Additionally, we interacted with several university students' voluntary and research groups, participated in educational games, and finally joined a Q&A session where we were asked to explain our project and provide exceptional information about it. Through this event, we had the opportunity to interact with voluntary groups, iGEM teams, and non-profit organizations, exchanging ideas.</p>

            <p>Even though Synthetic Biology has kept growing as a scientific field in the last few years and has attracted the interest of more and more young researchers, it is not yet well-known and widely applied in Greece. Our duty as a research group is to communicate and highlight the achievements and opportunities offered by the branch of science we have been studying. For this reason, we intended to spread Synthetic Biology and our idea among the academic community.</p>

                  <p>On June 16th, our team attended the 2nd Hellenic Conference "Present and Future of Oncology", at the University of Patras. Our Principal Investigator, Ms. Kallergi gave a presentation about the contribution of liquid biopsy in handling patients with cancer. She elaborated on the procedures needed to perform a liquid biopsy, the types of liquid biopsies, and the process from discovery to clinical application. She highlighted that more and more clinical studies focus on liquid biopsy, which is why it is a non-invasive procedure that can provide instrumental data about a person's health. Ms. Kallergi explained that according to the biomarkers detected in the patients' liquids, doctors could gain important information about the type and subtype of cancer and then select the best combination of drugs to target and eliminate cancer more efficiently. The presentation of our PI regarding liquid biopsies as the diagnostic method we have based our project on as a research team was enlightening for the academic audience who attended the conference.</p>

Therefore, starting from childhood, we decided to create a comic that would bring children closer to our idea and project. After all, knowledge is power. This is how we get young people into contact with health, wellness, cancer, and iGEMers through a delightful story. Our comic made the rounds of Greek schools, where the children had the opportunity to hear our story and read it. The comic is called the "lamp of health".</p>

                  <p>Searching for innovative approaches regarding science communication and public education for Synthetic Biology, we came up with the creation of a dictionary. Our "SynBio Dictionary" contains scientifically and accurately defined terms related to Synthetic Biology that are commonly used in our project. The terms are thoroughly explained and alphabetically sorted so that they can be easily reached by the reader. We also considered implementing this activity as a collaboration in order to enrich our dictionary with even more terms. So we invited 2 more teams to create their extension of our idea, adding more Synthetic Biology related words based on their project. 
                  <br>
                  To familiarize the reader of our website with scientific terms related to synthetic biology, we have included the definition of each term so that someone can learn about it by clicking on that word or phrase. This function is available mainly for laboratory terms contained on the <a class="link-ref" target="_blank" href="experiments">Experiments</a> page.

                  <p>In the context of "Education," we visited the Experimental High School of Patras to communicate synthetic biology to young people and students.</p>
                  <p>In the workshop area of the summer camp and with the supervising professor, Mr. Arlapanos Georgios, we encountered the members of the "Ludo ergo sum" team, and we were allowed to discuss our project and the team's achievements during the competition. However, the most important thing is that our goal was to introduce the students to the concept of synthetic biology. After giving a short presentation, we played the board games we created as a team which, in addition to entertainment, also have an educational role.</p>
                  <p>We noticed that the students found this way of learning particularly fun; however, during the game, we were allowed to realize any misunderstandings in the instruction manual and the design of the board games. This is due to the experience of Mr. Arlapanos and his team on designing board games since they actively develop blind-friendly board games as a team, receiving outstanding accolades.</p>
                  <p>Thus, they evaluated our final design, to point out any changes to us, but most importantly, for the students to learn some initial information about synthetic biology.</p>
                  <p>We learned two things from this first meeting. On the one hand, we can achieve the dissemination of synthetic biology more playfully to a portion of people who are not familiar with it. But on the other hand, we learned firsthand that knowledge is not one-sided and that the two teams within the framework of our cooperation had to learn from each other. We learned about tabletop design from the students' experience and Mr. Arlapanos, and those of us got a little taste of the concept of SynBio.</p>

                  <p>Visiting a High School in Patras, we had the opportunity to present our project and explain in a fun way Synthetic Biology basics through the board games we created. We played the board games for a second time, with a more significant portion of students striving to become upcoming medical students. We also presented the comic that we created as a team to the students, which describes in a more straightforward way how cancer works and how it can affect a person's life. </p>
                  <p>It is remarkable how interesting they found the activities we prepared for them and paid attention the whole time. Our role that day was not only to disseminate synthetic biology but also to inform future health scientists about the broader problem of lung cancer diagnosis and, by extension, prognosis.</p>
                  <p>To sum up, through our two meetings at the Experimental High School of Patras, we conclude that as Patras Medicine, we managed to teach the students the concept of complementarity, genetics, and the various variations that occur in the DNA of each person through the DNA Runner board game. On the other hand, we use the question-answer method through the Gene-us board game, the goal of which is for students to retain some of the basic concepts of synthetic biology - we know very well that this way of learning is more efficient. Furthermore, through the comic book "The Lamp of Health," we helped them to understand in a simple but at the same time explanatory way that many of our choices can affect our lives positively or negatively. Finally, we were given the opportunity to contribute to the vocational guidance of young people, considering that we are undergraduate students in the field of health sciences, participating in a synthetic biology competition, and dealing with such a combustive issue.</p>
                  <p>Overall, from our point of view, we have positively influenced the students, and our meetings have been productive.</p>

                  <p>After we had successfully visited schools and the summer camp, we got impressed by the interest students showed in our project and, most importantly, in Synthetic Biology. Most of them expressed their desire to study further and explore this scientific field. Therefore, we thought integrating Synthetic Biology into their lesson schedule would be helpful. For this reason, one of our team members, our advisor, wrote a whole chapter in which Synthetic Biology is scientifically defined, and further approaches and biosecurity are described in detail. This chapter is a proposed extension for the school book for high school students interested in this field so that they can be taught more about Synthetic Biology during their school life. </p>

                  <p>On September 2nd, we hosted an informative Webinar with title: "Lung Cancer: From Epidemiology to new forms of Diagnosis and Treatment" along with Cancer Prevention Research Group in Greece and our partners, iGEM MetaThess. The webinar had a great response and success, as approximately 300 people attended it. Young scientists have formed their presentations so that specialists and the general public can come into contact with topics such as pathophysiology, causes, epidemiology, primary symptoms, and diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to lung cancer in an understandable way. In this context, our team introduced project syn-PNOIA to the audience, emphasizing that late diagnosis of the disease can be faced based on Synthetic Biology. Among the speakers were administrative members of Cancer Prevention Research Group, doctors, associate professors of Chemistry, biologists, hygienists, health visitors, and undergraduate and postgraduate students from both iGEM teams, who gave engrossing speeches raising public awareness.</p>
