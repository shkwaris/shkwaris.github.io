      <h2 class="main-title">Introduction</h2>
      <p>During our fun journey to the iGEM competition, we found fellow travelers with the same dreams and goals. Thus, on March 3, excellent collaboration with the iGEM Thessaliniki_Meta team began. From our first meetings, we got to know each other, and after the presentation of the projects, we found that both teams intend to manufacture In vitro diagnostic tools for the early detection of non-small cell cancer of the lung (NSCLC). So we decided to solve the problem of the high mortality of lung cancer, reaching the top of DIAS with syn-PNOIA, that is, with collaboration. So we established meetings every Thursday to coordinate our common course and appointed responsible for the Partnership Anatoli Betsou from the Patras Medicine 2022 team and Maria Kosmidou from the Thessaliniki_Meta 2022 team.</p>
      <p>From our first steps, we planned to cooperate at all levels, that is, in Fundraising, in the Wet Lab, and the Dry Lab. We also organized joint actions for science communication and Synthetic Biology. We ranked interesting Collaborations among ourselves and with other teams. At the same time, in the context of Human Practices, we approached several Stakeholders who helped us improve our diagnostic tools so that they could be easily marketed. In addition, we attended a joint seminar on Safety, analyzed the 17 Goals for sustainable development of the United Nations, and organized webinars and workshops together. The most important thing was that we created a beautiful company in that we overcame difficulties and shared our anxieties and worries while having a good time in our online meetings. The best moment was when we met up close in Thessaloniki and had the time to organize joint actions together. Let's browse this page and follow us on our journey!</p>
      <p>Our Partnership's journey had stations every Thursday. So you can see more details about what we did here: </p>

                  <p>On the 3rd of March, we contacted iGEM Thessaliniki_Meta team on social media and arranged a video call to explore the possibility of cooperation. Thus, an online meeting took place between Maria Kosmidou and Anatoli Betsou. We briefly discussed our projects and thought of some ways of collaboration. So, we agreed to be partners and travel together in the world of Synthetic Biology. We decided to communicate every Thursday to coordinate our standard course. This is how our journey began!</p>

                  <p>On the 10th of March, we scheduled an online meeting to get to know each other. In the beginning, everyone introduced themselves by saying a few things about their work, and then we presented the two projects in detail. We then created a common communication platform, and the leaders of each subgroup discussed ways of possible cooperation in their field and scheduled different calls to discuss their progress in more detail.</p>

                  <p>On the 11th of March, Maria Kosmidou, Leader of Fundraising of the Thessaliniki_Meta team, trained our team about the steps a team must follow to find sponsors. So, together we made a sponsorship booklet, which includes information about iGEM Competition, our team members, our project description, our budget analysis, and specific sponsorship packages for our potential sponsors. The selling points were about how we can advertise our potential sponsors, for example, during our actions or on social media. We also prepared a list containing approximately 207 Pharmaceutical and Medical companies with their contact details and prepared the template mail we will send to the sponsors attaching the Booklet. The next day the communications started, and soon we ended up having as a joint grand sponsor the Research Genetic Cancer Center (RGCC Group), established in 2004 by Dr. Papasotiriou Ioannis, Oncologist.</p>

                  <p>On the 11th of April, we scheduled an online meeting with Mr. Apostolou Panagiotis. He is the Supervisor and Safety and Quality Manager at the Lab Facilities of the Research Genetic Cancer Center in Florina, Greece. First, Mr. Apostolou informed us about the protective measures we should follow in the lab for our safety. In particular, he mentioned the dress code and the mandatory lab coats, nitrile gloves, and protective glasses. He then discussed managing bacterial cultures and disposing of bacterial debris and agarose gels after electrophoresis. Finally, he mentioned how the eukaryotic cell lines worked, their cleanliness, and mandatory processing in particular laminar flows. Finally, he asked each group to study the escape plan, which follows the laboratory that works in fire, flood, and earthquake cases.</p>

After the presentation, they congratulated us on our innovative ideas, project design, and working method. Furthermore, they said they are particularly pleased that both teams are working on molecular diagnostic tools for the early diagnosis of lung cancer. They believe that our projects can impact the public, and with the proper steps, they could quickly be sold in diagnostic centers for the annual screening of patients for lung cancer in a few years. Also, they promised us that they would help us regarding the experimental design and the problems that may arise in the laboratory. Finally, they said they were pleased about our cooperation, wished us success in the competition, and ended their feedback by saying, "See you in Paris!"</p>

                  <p>On the 19th of May, we started cooperating on the Dry Lab part. One of the most crucial parts of our partnership with iGEM Thessaliniki_Meta team was the modeling process of our projects. We identified the need for a solid model that could predict and evaluate the behavior of our designed system. The partnership for the in-silico evaluation of our systems consists of 3 main parts. The first part is the evaluation of the thermodynamic properties of the designed sequence. Every project had identified the biomarker for the detection, and the next step was the design of the RNA sequences that could make the detection possible. After constructing a library of candidates’ sequences, we helped each other to select the ideal candidate. The software ViennaRNA was used to calculate the thermodynamic properties such as Minimum Free Energy structure, frequency of MFE in the ensemble, and the Concentration dependency plots. These results guided us in discerning the best candidate sequence for each biomarker.</p>

                  <p>The first Sunday of June is designated as World Cancer Survivors Day. Thus, since both teams were dealing with cancer-related projects, we wanted to honor the people who survived and beat this complex disease. So, we designed and created a graphic dedicated to this day and published it on our teams' social media. Furthermore, this publication was accompanied by a text we prepared that mentioned some statistics about deaths due to cancer and the importance of early diagnosis. Finally, we noted that the two teams are trying to solve the problem of high mortality so that the public stays tuned for the revelation of our Projects.</p>

These meetings were quietly beneficial for the experimental design and implementation of our projects since our cooperation led to the development of new ideas and the faster completion of “open” experimental issues that occupied both teams. Furthermore, during these meetings, extensive troubleshooting conversations were conducted, and different experimental protocols and tips and tricks were exchanged to accelerate the experimental procedures and achieve the desired results.</p>

                  <p>At the beginning of July, after receiving the first laboratory results, both teams started the business analysis of the Project. So we studied the Intellectual Property and designed the Business Model Canvas, where we filled in the value of our diagnostic tools to the target group while also doing an initial cost analysis. After that, we met each team's Fundraising Officers, introduced the BMCs to each other, and gave feedback to improve them.
                    <br><br>
                  In addition, because both Projects aim to create In vitro diagnostic tools for the same type of cancer, we did a stakeholders analysis and SWOT Analysis together. We also performed a market analysis and defined the target group, including people over 60 years old, smokers, and people who come into contact with harmful chemicals every day. Finally, we designed the Funding Strategy for future plans and looked for ways of funding in the European Union and Entrepreneurship and Continuity competitions in which we could participate.</p>

                  <p>The second part that we worked on together was the Molecular Dynamics Simulations. Evaluating the sequences with the ViennaRNA gave us insight into the interactions with the biomarkers based solely on the secondary structures. Therefore, we decided to take a step ahead and delve into finding information about RNA-RNA and protein-RNA interactions. iGEM Patras Medicine guided us through RNA – RNA molecular dynamics simulations with the oxRNA software. They presented their methodology and shared with us the pipeline needed to complete a simulation of this type. Still, we considered it more crucial to proceed with the Molecular dynamics of LbuCas13a-crRNA sequences since they play an essential role in our system’s behavior. We shared the appropriate literature to achieve our goals, and they helped us with the GROMACS software we based upon for the molecular dynamics simulations.</p>

                  <p>August 1st is World Lung Cancer Day. Since both our projects are related to this type of cancer, we decided to organize a joint activity. So we prepared an image showing the forms of all lung cancer subtypes, such as adenocarcinoma. Additionally, we wrote a text that included the definition of lung cancer. Then, we gave detailed information on each type of lung cancer, namely Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung cancer. Finally, we listed some statistics that prove the high mortality. So we published a post on social media containing this information announcing that both teams are working on Projects aimed at early diagnosis of lung cancer.</p>

                  <p>From our first steps, we were interested in studying the regulatory framework in which our Project is embedded and discovering the existing limitations. For this reason, we performed an insightful zoom meeting with Ms. Nikokavoura Aspasia, a Chemist, and Employee of the Health Material Evaluation Department of the National Organization for Medicines. National Organization for Medicines (EOF in Greek) is the regulatory organization in Greece for medicinal and pharmaceutical products for human and veterinary use, food supplements, medical aids, and cosmetics. We found out that our diagnostic tools are medical technology products. For such products, new legislation has been established (regulation 2017 746) that has facilitated the approval process so that it is carried out more directly, including all stages of the product. All products are classified into three categories according to their specialization, and ours is subject to category C. Conducting specific experiments to ensure the tool's effectiveness is strictly defined for each category. We were also informed that the exact completion of a technical file for our product is mandatory. This file should contain detailed information about the process and the production stages but also preclinical and clinical data and information about the stability and specificity of the product. After the file is completed with all of the above information, it must be sent to a notified body, which is the last step of the approval process.</p>

                  <p>On the 1st of September, we organized a meeting with our partners and a webinar to help the iGEM teams get one step closer to the Gold Medal of the Competition. Two workshops were planned in the webinar. The first was related to bioinformatics analysis, which programming languages ​​we use, and which databases we can analyze. In this way, we wanted to help iGEM teams to validate the biomarkers they chose for their projects and take their first steps towards modeling. The first session was held by Kardamiliotis Konstantinos, a member of the Thessaliniki_Meta team. In the second part of the webinar took place a workshop about Graphic Design. For the iGEM Competition, the teams are asked to make graphics for their actions or social media. So Dereki Eirini, a member of the Patras Medicine team, showed how to use the Adobe Illustrator program, a Graphic Design software. Using this program, a member of an iGEM team can create whatever graphic he wants to meet the needs of his team. The webinar had a great response, and the audience learned exciting tools used by a team for the complete implementation of the Project.</p>

This year, 212,000 people, including government members, visited the TIF. Both teams came into contact with visitors of different ages, where we described how their diagnostic tools work and how we propose adding them to the population's annual blood tests for the diagnosis of lung cancer in the early stages. Most showed great enthusiasm and confirmed the value of our diagnostic tools while sharing personal stories of relatives who died of cancer due to late diagnosis and limited treatment options. They encouraged us to continue the research and develop new diagnostic tools for other types of cancer as well and promised us that they would be among the first to test our test in a diagnostic center in the future. These new acquaintances motivated us to continue our research to finish our diagnostic devices and take them to the market soon. Finally, Patras Medicine team's members answered the questionnaire of the Thessaliniki_Meta team, which validated the value of our projects.</p>

                  <p>On Tuesday, 22.09.2022, our team visited with our partners the European Commission's office in Thessaloniki, Greece. After the project presentations, they congratulated us on our projects because they emphasized that they consider it essential to have easy-to-use diagnostic devices on the market and in diagnostic centers that will contribute to the early diagnosis of lung cancer. In addition, they told us that they looked at the lung cancer mortality statistics published by the World Health Organization and were disappointed. So, they were happy that there are research groups of young people trying to find a solution to such serious health problems. After manufacturing our diagnostic device, we were suggested to organize an information campaign mainly for high-risk groups such as smokers or people with asthma. Finally, they urged us to look up the European regulation related to in vitro diagnostic tools such as ours to see the approval process. Indeed, after this discussion, we arranged a meeting with a representative of the EMA (European Medical Agency) on October 1st for relevant information.</p>

                  <p>On Saturday, 1.10.2022, we scheduled with our partners iGEM Thessaliniki_Meta team, an online meeting with a European Medical Agency (EMA) representative. Firstly, we described the mechanism that our diagnostic tools use and the process that a microbiologist must follow to use the DIAS and syn-PNOIA tools and obtain the diagnostic result. The EMA Representative informed us that in 2021 the law 2017//0746 concerning medical devices for laboratory tests considered IVDs (in-vitro Diagnostics) was amended to be classified in the category of Companion Diagnostics. To file and get our tool approved for this category, we would have to associate it with a chemotherapy drug for lung cancer. So we searched the literature and suggested that the patient should be referred for more specialized tests in cases where our diagnostic test is positive.
                    <br><br>
                  Furthermore, once the cancerous tumor is established, cis-platin and paclitaxel should be administered to shrink the tumor. He also told us to carefully read the medical device legislation 2017/0746 and follow the steps outlined there. Finally, he recommended we contact the Ministry of Health and, more specifically, the HTA - Health Technology Assessment to inform us about the process we need to follow to add the syn-PNOIA diagnostic tool to the annual screening.</p>

                  <p>On the 2nd of October, in collaboration with the CPRG Group and iGEM Thessaliniki_Meta, we organized a webinar about lung cancer. In the webinar, some greetings from professors and speeches about the epidemiology of lung cancer and its types started. Then Mr. Velissariou Ilias and Mr. Βochalis Eleftherios presented the project of Patras Medicine 2022 group and the diagnostic methods used today. Finally, Mrs. Gouliou Ioanna and Mrs. Kosmidou Maria gave the project of iGEM Thessaliniki_Meta team and the therapeutic techniques used to treat lung cancer. The webinar was attended by approximately 300 people, including doctors, researchers, and journalists. At the end of the webinar, the audience's questions were resolved, and it was discussed how important prevention and early diagnosis are in diseases such as cancer. The public understood that surgery could save the patient if the cancerous tumor is detected early and has not metastasized. We received a lot of positive feedback from the public, which confirmed that there is a need for in vitro diagnostic tools that can easily, quickly, and cheaply diagnoses cancer. We are proud because many believed in our ideas and expressed interest in being among the first to do these diagnostic blood tests. Finally, they wished us all the best.</p>

                  <p>The final part of our dry lab collaboration was reaction kinetics analysis. iGEM Thessaliniki_Meta team informed us about the importance of predicting the fluorescence signal in our simulations to compare it with the experimental data. We were provided with the MATLAB script that our partners utilized to analyze their system, and we were given insights for constructing a simple but accurate model to predict these values.</p>

                  <p>On October 7th, the last virtual meeting between those responsible for the partnership occurred. At the specific meeting, iGEM Thessaliniki_Meta team showed the other the final form of their wiki and vice versa. Again, we emphasized the design of the partnership and shaped its final form for both our wiki pages.
                    <br><br>
                  It has been a long road, but we indeed gained so much from this ongoing collaboration as partners.
